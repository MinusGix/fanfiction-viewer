# Fanfiction Viewer  
Made to view fanfiction in a similar environment each time.  
  
Currently not too useful since it only supports fanfiction.net.  

## Supports:
* Fanfiction.net
* Archiveofourown (Could be better in code, and not perfect but it works.)
* More To Come

## Installing  
First run  
`npm install`  
in the folder.  
Then to use run  
`node index.js`  
The server will be started at `localhost:3000`  
Just go there in your browser and you will see
